# Few Shot X-Ray-Aanomlay-Detectection
This project presents an unsupervised pneumonia detection system using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with an EfficientNetB3-based encoder, leveraging transfer learning to enable effective representation learning in a few-shot setting using only normal chest X-ray images. The preprocessing pipeline includes lung segmentation to isolate the relevant region, CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) to enhance local contrast, and data augmentation techniques such as flips and rotations to improve generalization despite the limited training data. The model learns to reconstruct healthy X-rays, and during inference, it detects potential pneumonia cases by computing the reconstruction error. To improve anomaly discrimination, the system also calculates the Mahalanobis distance in the latent space, offering a more robust anomaly score that accounts for feature distribution. This dual-scoring approach enables accurate and scalable detection of pneumonia in medical imaging, particularly when labeled abnormal data is unavailable or scarce.
